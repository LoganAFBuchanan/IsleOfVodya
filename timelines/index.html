        <h3>Scouts from Adamaz</h3>
        <p>As the week drew to a close, The Appointed called the party to a meeting where she informed them of some terrible news coming out of the town of Adamaz. An army of undead lead by a powerful dwarf was marching out from its walls and seemed to be heading towards Gema and Prysma.</p>

        <h3>Encounter with Drakon</h3>
        <p>On their way to Adamaz the party rested at Gema, where Ultrich, under the power of the Deck of Many Things, betrayed Huginn and sent him to a strange realm with Andor Drakon. Here, Drakon outlined his goal for Vodya. A place where chaos can return and be stripped free of the claws of Order.</p>

        <h3>A Grave Choice</h3>
        <p>The next day the party was confronted by three badly burned individuals who came from Modyol. They came with reports of a dragon attacking Modyol and that support was needed. Upon weighing their options, the party decided they were better equipped to stop the threat coming from Adamaz, than to risk an encounter with the dragon.</p>
